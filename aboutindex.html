     <h1 class="title" style="font-size: 4vw;"> Welcome to my page</h1>
     <h2 style="font-size: 4vw;">About me</h2>
     <p>I love to visit new places and enjoy new people and surroundings. When IÂ was small, my parents took me to many beautiful temples and other places for picnics. Later, we went on a school tour with friends to amazing places like Darjeeling and Illam. Such wonderful scenery changed my perspective towards my home, Nepal. Capturing moments of natural and cultural beauty, with adventerous and loving people, in a single image makes me feel so fortunate. After coming to Australia, I visited and photographed famous places such as the opera house, plus some stunning beaches which left me feeling such peace and freedom. I am looking forward to sharing my favourite images and stories from around the world here with you.

        HAPPY TRAVEL!
